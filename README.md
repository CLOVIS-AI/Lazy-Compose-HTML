# Lazy layouts for Compose HTML

Lazy layouts for [Compose HTML](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform#compose-html).

## Usage

Add a dependency on the library:
```kotlin
// Configure the project for Kotlin Multiplatform
// Don't forget to add the Compose plugin

kotlin {
	js(IR) {
		browser()
	}
	
	sourceSets.jsMain.dependencies {
		implementation("dev.opensavvy.compose.lazy:lazy-layouts:<version>")
	}
}
```
To select a version, see the [list of releases](https://gitlab.com/opensavvy/ui/compose-lazy-html/-/releases).

This library introduces lazy layout implementations that work with Compose HTML:
```kotlin
@Composable
fun ShowUsers(users: List<UserId>) {
    LazyColumn {
        items(users) { userId ->
            var user by remember { mutableStateOf<User?>(null) }

            LaunchedEffect(userId) {
                user = requestUser(userId)
            }

            user?.also { Show(it) }
        }
    }
}
```

## Features

- Items are loaded batch by batch when the end of the loaded section is reached.
- Items can change size.
- Sections can change over time by editing the backing list, items from other sections are not reloaded.
- The library only adds the most minimal CSS to make the containing `div` use flex, the style is entirely customizable with plain CSS or through the Compose HTML `attrs` builder.
